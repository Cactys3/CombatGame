extends Attachment


# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready() -> void:
	super()


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	pass

#how should attachment extenders work?
#Create methods for ProcessCooldown(delta) and Attack() that extenders override.
#Create generic methods for creating a projectile with the right size/parent so extenders can use that
#extenders should always (with exceptions) call super on read and process 
#extenders have their own hitbox references and do all that themselves
#extenders have their own animations but have to include handle in these animations? or animations work to change position of weapon_frame?
